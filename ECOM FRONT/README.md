ECOM - React E-commerce Web Application

ECOM is a modern and responsive React-based E-commerce web application designed to provide a smooth online shopping experience. The platform allows users to browse products in grid or list views, view detailed product information with images and descriptions, add products to the cart, and manage quantities easily. It also includes a cart summary and a simulated checkout process, making it suitable for learning and demonstration purposes.

The project is built using React.js for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, and React Context API with reducers for state management. All components are reusable, including buttons, headers, footers, and product cards, ensuring a clean and modular code structure. The application is fully responsive, working seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

To set up the project, users can clone the repository, install dependencies with npm, and start the development server to see the application running locally. The repository is structured with separate directories for components, context, reducers, and styles, keeping the project organized and easy to navigate.

Future enhancements for the project include integrating real payment gateways, adding user authentication features such as login and signup, creating an admin dashboard for managing products, and implementing search functionality for quick product lookup.

This project was developed by Onkar Jamma and is hosted on GitHub. It demonstrates practical knowledge of React development, state management, and modern styling techniques while serving as a functional e-commerce platform prototype.
